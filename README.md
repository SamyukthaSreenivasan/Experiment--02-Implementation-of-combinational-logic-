Implementation of combinational logic gates
 
## AIM:
To implement the given logic function verify its operation in Quartus using Verilog programming.
 F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D
 
## Equipments Required:
- Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher
-  Software – Quartus prime

## Theory:
Logic gates are electronic circuits which perform logical functions on one or more inputs to produce one output.
#### OR Gate:
The OR gate is a fundamental digital logic gate that operates on two binary inputs, producing an output of 1 if at least one input is 1. It symbolizes logical disjunction and is essential in building logical circuits and decision-making processes in computers and electronics.
#### AND Gate:
The AND gate is a fundamental digital logic gate with two inputs and one output. It produces a high output (1) only when both input signals are high (1). If any input is low (0), the output remains low. It's a building block for more complex logic circuits and is integral in digital computations.
#### NOT Gate:
The NOT gate is a fundamental digital logic gate. It has a single input and a single output. The output is the inverse of the input: if the input is high (1), the output is low (0), and vice versa. It's a basic building block in digital circuits, used for logic inversion.
 
## Procedure:-
1. Create a New Project:
   - Open Quartus and create a new project by selecting "File" > "New Project Wizard."
   - Follow the wizard's instructions to set up your project, including specifying the project name, location, and target device (FPGA).

2. Create a New Design File:
   - Once the project is created, right-click on the project name in the Project Navigator and select "Add New File."
   - Choose "Verilog HDL File" or "VHDL File," depending on your chosen hardware description language.

3. Write the Combinational Logic Code:
   - Open the newly created Verilog or VHDL file and write the code for your combinational logic.
     
4. Compile the Project:
   - To compile the project, click on "Processing" > "Start Compilation" in the menu.
   - Quartus will analyze your code, synthesize it into a netlist, and perform optimizations based on your target FPGA device.

5. Analyze and Fix Errors:*
   - If there are any errors or warnings during the compilation process, Quartus will display them in the Messages window.
   - Review and fix any issues in your code if necessary.
   - View the RTL diagram.

6.*Verification:
   - Click on "File" > "New" > "Verification/Debugging Files" > "University Program VWF".
   - Once Waveform is created Right Click on the Input/Output Panel > " Insert Node or Bus" > Click on Node Finder > Click On "List" > Select All.
   - Give the Input Combinations according to the Truth Table amd then simulate the Output Waveform.
